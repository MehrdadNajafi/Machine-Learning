# Assignment 40
## Titanic Prediction with MLP, Perceptron, KNN
- Use machine learning to create a model that can predict survivors of the Titanic
  - Execute predict on test data and report results
  - Save MLP model
  - Compare the accuracy of the models

| Algorithm | KNN | Perceptron | MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) |
| :----:  | :----:  | :----:  | :----: |
| Accuracy  | 80 % | 67 % (r2 squared) | 85 % |
